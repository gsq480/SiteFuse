# SiteFuse Agency

A professional parent theme for a web design agency, built as a classic PHP theme using Tailwind CSS v4.

## Build
From the theme folder:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
This produces `dist/tailwind.css` which the theme enqueues.

## Activate
Upload to `wp-content/themes/` then activate in wp‑admin or via WP‑CLI:
```bash
wp theme activate sitefuse-agency
```
